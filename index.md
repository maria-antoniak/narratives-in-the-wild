# Addressing Misinformation Through Narrative Understanding

Narratives in the Wild is building a collaborative annotation infrastructure to identify and label the "big, sticky stories" that spread across social media platforms. Instead of fact-checking individual posts, we focus on understanding the underlying narrative patterns that contribute to misinformation ecosystems.

Our open research platform brings together researchers, community members, and users to collaboratively annotate narrative patterns on Bluesky, creating transparent datasets for interdisciplinary research.
